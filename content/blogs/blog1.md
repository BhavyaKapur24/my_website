title: Should you invest in Cryptocurrency? 
---

Cryptocurrency is a digital alternative to our standard cash money that holds its value in terms of the supply and demand rather than a centralized regulatory authority. It is denominated in terms of virtual tokens and its system is based on cryptographic proof instead of trust. The cryptographic proof comes in the form of transactions that are verified and recorded in a form of program called a blockchain.

Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that records transactions in code. Transactions are recorded in blocks that are then linked together on a chain of previous cryptocurrency transactions. Software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate. A miner in cryptocurrency network confirms transactions. They take transactions, mark them as legitimate, and allow them to be spread all over the system. Miners are then rewarded within the existing domain of cryptocurrency through whatever type of currency is being used. Hence, newer units of cryptocurrency are released through this process of mining.

Cryptocurrency can be purchased on peer-to-peer networks and cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase and Bitfinex. They can be used to make purchases too, but it’s not a form of payment with mainstream acceptance quite yet. This may change in the near future, however.Cryptocurrencies hold the promise of making it easier to transfer funds directly between two parties, without the need for a trusted third party like a bank or credit card company. Fund transfers are completed with minimal processing fees, allowing users to avoid the steep fees charged by banks and financial institutions for wire transfers. However. since market prices for cryptocurrencies are based on supply and demand and the design of many cryptocurrencies ensures a high degree of scarcity, the rate at which a cryptocurrency can be exchanged for another currency can fluctuate widely.

The semi-anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes cryptocurrencies well-suited for a host of illegal activities, such as money laundering and tax evasion. However, cryptocurrency advocates often highly value their anonymity, citing benefits of privacy like protection for whistleblowers or activists living under repressive governments. Moreover, some cryptocurrencies are more private than others. 
The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular. Today, there are thousands of alternate cryptocurrencies with various functions and specifications. Some of these are clones of Bitcoin, while others are new currencies that were built from scratch. Some competing cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins include Litecoin, Peercoin, and Namecoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and EOS.
Mainstream institutional adoption along with the on boarding of Visa, Mastercard and Paypal to the market as payment facilitators has strengthened the belief in future acceptance of cryptocurrencies. There are also suggestions about providing company cryptocurrency as payment to company employees in the early stage of business and utilizing cryptocurrency in Crowdfunding to increase transparency. However, to function effectively as a currency alternative, crypto must be liquid, possess relatively low price volatility, and be integrated with established financial institutions. 

The wide fluctuations in mainstream cryptos like Bitcoin tell a different story altogether. The price discovery process of Bitcoin is difficult both for current holders and for those attempting to integrate bitcoin and other crypto into the wider financial system. Combined with the amount of speculation in the market, it hinders the possibility of using Bitcoin as a currency. 

Other applications that have emerged more recently, namely stablecoins, look potentially better positioned to push blockchain and crypto adoption forward. Stablecoins can be summarized as cryptocurrencies that are backed, tethered, or otherwise supported by an underlying asset. Stablecoins can be backed or supported by virtually any asset imaginable, but the U.S. dollar seems to be a popular asset to stabilize cryptocurrencies with. These are also closely connected to decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) providing them a stable underpinning. Stablecoins are looking more and more like the foundation for creative blockchain and crypto applications, specifically because they are the less volatile option.

While there is positivity about the future of cryptocurrencies, buying them is very much like early-stage investing, and investors should expect venture capital like outcomes. Whether crypto assets pay off for investors will ultimately be determined by whether they achieve wide-scale adoption. Vast majority of crypto projects fail and become worthless. Hence, only a small number of projects will ultimately succeed, and it's unclear if these big wins will be enough to offset the many losses. The speculative market conditions and the uncertainty about government’s future regulations make it an even risky bet. Overall, in the current landscape, it is safer to stick to currency that is backed by the government.
