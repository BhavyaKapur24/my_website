title: About Me
---
My name is Bhavya Kapur. I am pursuing MFA from London Business School. I have completed my graduation in BBA (Financial Investment Analysis) from Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies.

As a student, I have always strived to maintain a strong and consistent academic record while excelling at co-curricular activities. My tenure as the President of Alumni Relations and Outreach Cell of our college has contributed massively in my personality development and individual growth. The cell, being a recent student initiative, has provided me with a platform to sharpen my design thinking and analytical skills.

I have a zest for learning and keenness to gain as much knowledge and experience as I can. To quench my thirst for knowledge, I pursued various courses in Finance including the Financial Modelling and Algo Trading course. I also pursued a course in Applied Financial Technology to gain in-depth knowledge about how FinTech is transforming businesses across the world.
I have interned at various organizations including:

KPMG: Strategy and Operations
Savills: Summer Intern-International Markets
Kinduz Consulting: MSME Division
Investors Avenue: MSME Division
