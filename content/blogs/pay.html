<p>At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted.</p>
<p>You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There seems to be a significant difference between female and male salaries. In fact, while the confidence interval for femalesâ€™ salaries goes from 61,486 to 67,599, the one for men goes from 70,088 to 76,390. In other words, the two CIs do not overlap, something that suggests us to directly reject the null hypothesis that the two means are equal.</p>
<p>You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using <code>t.test()</code> and with the simulation method from the <code>infer</code> package.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>First of all, since the p value is lower than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis at a 95% confidence level. In other words, we can say that there is a statistically significant difference between the means man and female salaries.</p>

<h2>Relationship Experience - Gender?</h2>
<p>At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).</p>

<p>At any reasonable significance level we can reject the H0 in favour of H1 - there is a significant difference between the experience of executives of different gender. This can be an explanation for salary difference.</p>

<h2>Check correlations between the data</h2>
<p>You can use <code>GGally:ggpairs()</code> to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to <code>ggpairs()</code> with <code>aes</code> arguments to colour by <code>gender</code> and make ths plots somewhat transparent (<code>alpha  = 0.3</code>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>omega %&gt;% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %&gt;% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes (colour = gender, alpha = 0.3))+

<blockquote>
<p>Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the plot we can infer that salary and experience are positively correlated. In fact, salary increases as experience increases. We can also infer that salary variability is highest in the first years of experiences, then it decreases when experiences in between 1 and 15 years, and then it increases again for employees with several years of experience.</p>
